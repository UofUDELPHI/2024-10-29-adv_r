To generate the GitHub pages website for your repository and trigger automatic deployments when changes are pushed to the repo, you need to set Settings > Pages > Branch settings to 'main' and choose '/docs/' to trigger a deployment when modifications are made on the main branch.

To make changes to the website, you can then make changes in the **main branch**, render your changes in your local version, and then push the changes to GitHub. The website should automatically update within a few minutes.
