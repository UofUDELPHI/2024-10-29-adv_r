## General Information

**What**: This workshop will build upon the foundations covered in the Introduction to R workshop, and will introduce more advanced tools, including creating your own custom functions, iterating with purrr map functions, advanced data manipulations with dplyr, and reshaping and joining datasets in R.

**Who**: The course is aimed at graduate students, postdocs, staff, faculty, and other researchers across campus who are interested in taking their R skills to the next level to learn how to conduct more sophisticated data manipulations and analysis. 

Participants in this workshop should already be comfortable working in Quarto (or R Markdown) documents in RStudio, and have basic knowledge of the the R programming language and the tidyverse, including the dplyr select, filter, mutate, and summarize functions, as well as creating basic visualizations using ggplot2.

**Requirements**: Participants must bring a laptop onto which they can [download R and Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (and you should do so before the workshop).
