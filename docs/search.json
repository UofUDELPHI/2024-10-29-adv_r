    "text": "General Information\nWhat: This workshop will build upon the foundations covered in the Introduction to R workshop, and will introduce more advanced tools, including creating your own custom functions, iterating with purrr map functions, advanced data manipulations with dplyr, and reshaping and joining datasets in R.\nWho: The course is aimed at graduate students, postdocs, staff, faculty, and other researchers across campus who are interested in taking their R skills to the next level to learn how to conduct more sophisticated data manipulations and analysis.\nParticipants in this workshop should already be comfortable working in Quarto (or R Markdown) documents in RStudio, and have basic knowledge of the the R programming language and the tidyverse, including the dplyr select, filter, mutate, and summarize functions, as well as creating basic visualizations using ggplot2.\nRequirements: Participants must bring a laptop onto which they can download R and Rstudio (and you should do so before the workshop).\nContact: Please email andrew.george@hsc.utah.edu or rebecca.barter@hsc.utah.edu for more information."
